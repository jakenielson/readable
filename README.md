# Readable

A content and comment site I am building with React, Redux, and Bootstrap. Modeled after the popular site Reddit, this application allows the user to navigate between posts and comments organized by topic. React controls the various view components. Redux handles the bulk of the data fetched from a provided backend server. The react-redux tool hooks the two together, letting the Redux store be the single source of truth for the entire application. I'm using Bootstrap, Sass, and Gulp  to style the app.

## To Run

To run the project, clone or download the repository and navigate to the 'api-server' folder. Install the dependencies with `npm install`. Start the server with `npm start`.

Once the server is running, navigate to the 'frontend' folder. Install the dependencies with `npm install`. Start the app with `npm start`.
